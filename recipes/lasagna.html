            Perfect Lasagna Recipe
        </h2>
        This Perfect Lasagna Recipe is a classic and such a delicious meal for serving a
        <br>crowd. It’s also an easy main dish to make ahead and easily bake to warm before
        <br>serving.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have a few go-to dishes that are easily prepped ahead with little attention needed
        <br>just before serving. This Perfect Lasagna Recipe would be one of those. Lasagna is
        <br>great for being able to totally make it days ahead of time (or longer than that and
        <br>freeze it!) and easily bake until it’s warm and all melty. Serve it with a big salad, maybe
        <br>some bread, and you’re good to go!
    </p>
    <p>
        Lasagna is such a delicious crowd-pleaser, and this lasagna recipe is no exception.
        <br>Enjoy!

            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown sausage in large dutch oven or stock pot over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Push browned sausage to the side of pot; add chopped onion and sauté for about
                <br> 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in red wine and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, bay leaves, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder,
                <br>1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper; stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Continue
                <br>to simmer over medium for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and
                <br>adjust seasonings. Reduce heat to low-medium low, cover and continue to cook
                <br>for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375-degrees F. Cook lasagna noodles according to package
                <br>instructions; drain, set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk together egg, ricotta cheese, parsley, remaining 1/4 teaspoon garlic
                <br>powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread about 2 1/2 cups of meat sauce (remember to remove
                <br>the bay leaves) in the bottom of a 9x13 inch deep baking pan. Arrange 4 noodles
                <br>lengthwise over meat sauce. Evenly spread 1/3 (about 2/3 cup) of the
                <br>egg/ricotta cheese mixture over top. Evenly spread 1 1/2 cup of shredded
                <br>mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce evenly over mozzarella.
                <br>Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers. Spread remaining meat
                <br>sauce on top, and finish by topping with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
                <br>cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Cover with foil being careful to leave room above cheese to avoid cheese sticking
                <br>to foil. Bake in 375-degree F oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil, lower
                <br>temperature to 350-degrees F and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until
                <br>cheese is melted and slightly browned. Cool for about 15-20 minutes before
                <br>serving.
