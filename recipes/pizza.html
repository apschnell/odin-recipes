        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven. If you use a wood-fired pizza oven, preheat it until the floor of the oven
                <br>is around 850°F (430°C) and the ceiling is around 900°F (480°C). You can check the
                <br>temperature using an infrared thermometer. If you use a home oven, place a pizza stone or
                <br>steel in the oven and preheat on the hottest setting for at least 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Take out one dough ball from the rising box using a dough using pizza spatula or dough
                <br>scraper. Sprinkle some flour around the edge of the dough ball and use the spatula to
                <br>loosen all the sides (if it’s stuck to other dough balls or and edge), then get it under the ball
                <br>and lift it right out.
            </li>
            <li>Place the dough ball in a small pile of flour and press it gently from the center using
                <br>the palm of your hands. Make sure to leave 1/2 inch (1cm) around the edge of the dough to
                <br>form the crust (cornicione). Then stretch it into a 10-11 inch (25-27cm) round disc.
            </li>
            <li>Add 60-80g of Neapolitan pizza sauce in the center of the disc, and spread it evenly with
                <br>the back of a spoon using circular motion.
            </li>
            <li>Add cheese and other toppings(optional)</li>
            <li>In a home oven, bake the pizza for for 4-8 minutes on a pizza stone or steel, depending
                <br>on how hot your oven is. And if you have a grill function or broiler, turn it on during baking
                <br>for an even hotter bake. That’s going to get you pretty close to the heat of a pizza oven!
